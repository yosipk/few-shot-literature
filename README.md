# Learning from small amount of labeled data 
**Few-shot learning** is a general umbrella term for learning models with a small amount of data. 
It is usually assumed that the models are learned in supervised manner, and that the _labeled_ data is scarce. 
The approaches to learning from small amount labeled data are:
* **transfer learning**: learning new model by adapting an existing model, usually learned for related tasks
* **semi-supervised learning**: learning with small amount of labeled data and a larger amount of unlabeled data
* **meta-learning**: learning to learn with small amount of labeled data by learning in few-shot episodes
